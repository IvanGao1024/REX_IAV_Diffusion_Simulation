# REX_IAV_Diffusion_Simulation

This is the repository for the University of British Columbia Undergraduate Research Experience Program Math Bio Group 2023-11 to 2024-03, consisting of Yuan Gao and Marusia Shevchuk under the supervision of Liam Yih. The code is developed in Julia, and the mathematical parameters are derived from Vahey and Fletcher's paper [1].

## Research question: Simulation of influenza A virus (IAV) mobility under different ligand organization and diffusion coefficients
